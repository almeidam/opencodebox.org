GraphRisk was born from Dinis as an attempt to map the IT ecosystem of the organisation and the data flow between these systems (Data Journey in GDPR language). The project succeeded the initial scope of mapping the data journey within Photobox and gave insight to the governance and risk teams on how to use a graph data base to inspect data flows between systems.

The projects was designed to be able to represent the technological ecosystem, therefore GDPR pattern is not the only use-case. Dinis proposed to use this project as an open source solution for other organisations to visualise their data in a graphical way.
